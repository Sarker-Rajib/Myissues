              any posted content would violate our terms of service, gives

              please report it to us by clicking the "Report Ad" button located
              on every Ad. If you suspect that content posted breaks the law by
              violating the copyright law, please report that here.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Ad Rules</h3>
            <p>There are the rules we ask users to follow when posting ads:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Always post ads in the correct category</li>
              <li>
                Users can post as many paid ads as they like. No one likes spam
                though, please respect your fellow advertisers not overdoing it.
              </li>
              <li>You can only post up to 4 free ads.</li>
              <li>
                Creating multiple accounts to post free ads in unpaid categories
                is not permitted. We only allow 1 account per user.
              </li>
              <li>
                We encourage you to promote your ad on our website to increase
                your Donations.
              </li>
              <li>
                we ask that you do NOT use our site to promote other competing
                websites.
              </li>
              <li>Always use your common sense and better judgment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Withdraw From My Account</h3>

            <p>
              I withdraw using cryptocurrency, but it’s not reflecting my wallet
              yet. Is this normal?
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't panic! Cryptocurrency transactions can occasionally
              encounter delays that are beyond our control. If you don’t see the
              amount credited to your Blockchain wallet immediately, you should
              not worry. This is due to delayed processing times on Blockchain.
              Smaller transactions generally take longer, whilst larger
              transactions tend to take less time. To play it safe, we recommend
              using your Account regularly, so that you always have available
              funds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Withdraw funds using e-transfer. It is easy just to provide an
              email address and funds will be transferred to that e-mail account
              instant.

            <h2 class="main-heading pt-4 pb-2">Upgrades And Features</h2>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">1. What is a Bump?</h3>
            <p>
              When you bump one of your ads, it is pushed to the first position
              of the page in which it appears. You can only use Bumps for the
              specific ad you purchased it for, so they can't be transferred
              between your ads.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">2. How does Page 1 work?</h3>
            <p>
              Page 1 allows you to have your ads automatically kept on the first
              page of the list in the region/city they appear in. For the
              duration of your Page 1 upgrade, it will automatically be bumped
              each time it drops off the first page so that it returns to the
              very top of it. The process will then repeat itself until the
              upgrade expires. If your ad does not drop off the first page
              within 2h 20m, it will still be automatically bumped to the top
              again.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">
              3. What does the Auto Repost upgrade do?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Auto Repost allows you to create a schedule for your ads to be
              bumped to the very top of the list in which it appears at specific
              times of the day. Once you have purchased an Auto Repost for one
              of your ads, it is possible to extend the number of days it will
              run for, but it is NOT possible to add or remove the number of
              times per day that the ad is bumped. Please also note that any
              changes you make to its schedule will only take effect the
              following day.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">4. What is a Mane page Ad?</h3>
            <p>
              It is an ad that appears on the Mane page of the Myissues website.
              Stand out from the crowd!
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">5. How do I edit my Mane page Ad?</h3>
            <p>
              Simply log into your account, and visit the Ad Center. Here you
              will find a list of your ads, and you can then select the ad that
              you purchased the Mane page Ad upgrade for. Then just click on
              ‘edit ad’ and you will see 'Ad'. Click on this, and you can edit
              your ad. When you have finished doing this, please make sure that
              you save your changes.

            <h3 class="sub-heading">
              6. What happens to my upgrades if I delete my ad?
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you delete an ad, it is instantly removed, and all upgrades
              associated with it are lost.
            </p>

              my ads?
            </h3>
            <p>
              It will copy the entire ad that you clicked 'copy' on and take you
              to the post ad page so you can use it to create a new ad. You will
              then be able to continue through the various steps and it will
              also be possible for you to edit any of the pre-filled sections.
